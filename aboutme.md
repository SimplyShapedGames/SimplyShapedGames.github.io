## A short resume

Hi there!
My name is **Storm Eckhart**, and I'm the owner of **SimplyShapedGames**. 
Started in 2017, SSG was created to give myself some motivation to create and especially finish proper professional game projects. 
It seems to have worked, as **I've just recently published my first hypercasual game** "_Slide - Simple Yet Fun_" (available on **Android/IOS**).
With a few more projects ongoing, I hope to soon publish more exciting and fun video games, for all to enjoy!

# Thanks for reading!
